= ruby-nxt

==== The ruby-nxt library lets you control the LEGO Mindstorms NXT robotics kit via Bluetooth using the Ruby language.

<em>This library is currently in the early stages of development and is far from complete.</em>

There are two interfaces:

- The NXT class provides a high-level, multi-threaded, object-oriented interface.
  Currently only motor functionality is implemented (sensors aren't).
  
- The NXTComm class provides low-level direct access to the NXT Bluetooth
  protocol.
  
ruby-nxt requires ruby-serialport which you must download and install from:
