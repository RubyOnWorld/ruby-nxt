	#   m.forward(:degrees => 360, :power => 20)
	#
	# The above rotates the motor 360 degrees forward at 20% power.
	#

	# The above rotates the motor forwards for 5 seconds at 25% power
	# (because 25% is the default).

	# The data available is as follows:
	# [+:port+] Motor's port. This will always be equal to +self.port+. 
	# [+:power+] Current power setting. 0 to 100.
	# [+:mode+] Current output mode. See NXTComm constants.
	# [+:regulation+] Current power regulation mode. See NXTComm constants.
	# [+:ratio+] Gear scaling ratio. This should always be equal to +self.ratio+.
	# [+:run_state+] Current output run state. See NXTComm constants.
	# [+:degree_limit+] The rotation limit previously set. 0 means no limit.
	# [+:tacho_count+] Internal tachometer count.
	# [+:tacho_count_block+] Total relative rotation count (for the motor or the nxt??)
	# [+:degree_count+] The total relative degrees turned since the last Motor#reset_tacho call.
	# 									Turning backwards adds negative values, so this can go negative.

	### low level commands ######################################################
	
	# Low-level command for initiating motor rotation.
	# Options is a hash with the following keys:
	# [+:power+] Power from 0 to 100. Default is 25.
	# [+:time+] Maximum time to run the motor in seconds. 
	# 					By default there is no time limit.
	# 					If :degrees is also specified then the motor
	# 					will only turn as far as :degrees and will stop and
	# 					wait out the remaining :time has expired.
	# [+:regulate+] False to disable power regulation. It is true (i.e. on)
	# 					by default.
	# [+:degrees+] The maximum tachometer degrees to turn before automatically
	# 					stopping. Use negative values for backward movement (need to
	# 					double check that this is in fact true)
	# [+:direction+] Direction in which the motor should move. 1 for forward,
	# 					-1 for backward. The default is 1 (i.e. forward).
	# 
	# Examples:
	# 
	# 	m.run(:degrees => 90, :direction => -1)
	# 
	# The above will rotate backward up to 90 degrees.
	# 
	#   m.run(:time => 8, :power => 100)
	# 
	# The above will rotate forward for 8 seconds at 100% power.
	# 
	# 	m.run(:power => 50, :degrees => 180, :time => 3)
	# 
	# The above will rotate forward for 3 seconds up to 180 degrees at 50% power.
	# If the 180 degree rotation takes only 1 second to complete, the motor will
	# sit there and wait out the full 3 seconds anyway.
	# 
	#   m.run
	#   
	# The above will rotate forward indefinitely (until +m.stop+ is called).
